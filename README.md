# Rainbow Tabs

It's a Chrome extension to sort your tabs by favicon color.

Uses lokesh's [color-thief](https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief). 

## In progress
* Use first dominant color that is not black/white/gray
* Other dominant color tweaks (what if pink/navy represented equally?)
* Add feature to restore pre-rainbow tab ordering
* A better icon or something. It is currently rainbow cake from Martha Stewart

## Usage
1. Clone rainbow-tabs
2. Go to Settings -> Extensions in Chrome
3. Check "Developer Mode" in upper right
4. Click "Load unpacked extension" button and open your rainbow-tabs directory
5. Use it, edit it, reload extension, etc
